## How It Works

### Recipe Generation Flow

1. **User Input**: Fill out preferences (cuisine, dietary needs, skill level, etc.)
2. **Taste Analysis**: System analyzes your saved/loved recipes (if logged in)
3. **AI Generation**: Claude Sonnet 4 creates a personalized recipe
4. **Display**: Recipe shown with full details and nutrition info
5. **Save/Love**: Optionally save and mark as favorite for future personalization

### Taste Profile System

The taste profile automatically learns from your interactions:

- **Cuisines**: Identifies patterns in recipe names and descriptions
- **Ingredients**: Tracks your most-used ingredients
- **Difficulty**: Understands your preferred complexity level
- **Timing**: Calculates average cooking time preferences
- **Nutrition**: Averages macro targets from saved recipes
- **Dietary Patterns**: Detects common restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)

Loved recipes are weighted higher in the analysis, making your favorites more influential in future recommendations.

## Firebase Setup

### Firestore Collections

- `users`: User profiles with usernames and profile pictures
- `savedRecipes`: User's saved recipes with love status

### Storage Structure

- `profile-pictures/{userId}/`: User profile images

### Security Rules

Ensure proper Firestore security rules are configured:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- Authentication required for all operations
